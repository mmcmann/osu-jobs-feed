    <title>Director-00</title>
    <content>&lt;b&gt; The Organization &lt;/b&gt; 

Established in 2008, the Office of Investments was created to ensure strategic management of the University's Long-Term Investment Pool.  The Office of Investment's goal is to deliver long-term, attractive, risk-adjusted returns to support the educational and research goals of the university. The investment team continuously strives to identify market opportunities where price and underlying value are misaligned.

The Office of Investments has adopted an asset allocation model that groups assets into three broad thematic categories. This model enables the investment team to be responsive to changing market conditions. The asset allocation model is implemented by partnering with external managers, which allows the Office of Investments to build a portfolio of specialized investment teams from around the world to implement our strategic allocation. The investment portfolio currently includes public equity, fixed income, hedge funds, and real assets. While generating strong real returns over market cycles is important, we also believe active risk management is a critical part of our investment process.  

Our mission is to focus on the management of the $3.6 billion University's Long-Term Investment Pool with the goal of delivering strong risk-adjusted rates of returns over time. We strive to manage the portfolio for maximum long-term real returns commensurate with the risk tolerance of the University. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt; The Opportunity &lt;/b&gt; 
The Office of Investments is seeking to hire a Senior Investment Director responsible for managing the private equity team and leading all requirements of the private equity program, which includes real estate, venture capital, private credit and real assets, developing and recommending portfolio construction strategies, leading the sourcing of new private equity investment opportunities (partnership commitments and co-investments), analyzing, negotiating and recommending investments, monitoring investment activities, participating on advisory committees and establishing goals.  Recruits, trains, coaches and evaluates junior investment staff.  Requires domestic and international travel related to annual and advisory committee meetings, due diligence meetings and industry conferences, an energetic and disciplined approach to investment, and an ability to develop a continually expanding global network within the investment management community.
