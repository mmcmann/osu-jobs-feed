## Problem

We'd like you to build an application (in your preferred programming
language) that uses job postings from [https://www.jobsatosu.com] (ATOM feed:
[https://www.jobsatosu.com/all_jobs.atom] ) to do something cool. One idea could
be a new user interface for the jobs board but you may have other ideas.

## Features

We would like to see your implementation of the following two features:

1. Order
    * view all available postings
    * order the results by job title
    * order the results by the posting department
2. Filter
    * filter the results to see only a subset of the above categories

We will be looking for: application of best practices for software development,
good usability, code cleanliness, technical design and implementation, and even
a bit of creativity.
